Images in this folder will not be added to source control.

Unit Tests can write images to this folder for quick viewing.

If you want to permanently add images for Kumo to showcase, add them to `kumo-core/output/`.

The point of this directory is to encourage more unit tests without resulting in all new images to be checked into source control, but we want the images to be easy to view within IntelliJ.
